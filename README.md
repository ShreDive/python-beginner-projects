# Python-Projects
This repository contains a collection of 10 beginner-to-intermediate Python console-based projects built as part of my structured daily Python learning journey. Each project focuses on strengthening core programming skills such as loops, conditionals, user input handling, menu-driven design, list & tuple operations, string manipulation, and basic algorithms.

### Completed Projects
1. **3-Step Login System**  
   A basic authentication system with username/password validation, attempt limits, and account lockout.

2. **Menu-Driven Utility App**  
   A multi-feature console tool offering greeting, addition, palindrome checking, and structured menu navigation.

3. **Palindrome Checker**  
   Reverse-string based algorithm to detect palindromes.

4. **Even/Odd & Number Operations Programs**  
   Loop-based exercises printing patterns, ranges, prime numbers, and sequences.

5. **Simple Banking System**  
   Deposit, withdraw, and check balance inside a loop-driven banking console.

6. **Expense Tracker App**  
   Stores expenses using lists/tuples, maintains running totals, and displays full expense history.

###  Upcoming Projects (Being Added in Phases)
7. **Mini Calculator**  
   Supports multiple arithmetic operations with user-selected functionality.

8. **Contact Book App**  
   Add, search, view, and delete contacts using Python lists/dictionaries.

9. **Caesar Cipher Encryption Tool**  
   Implements classical character-shift encryption & decryption logic.

10. **Inventory Management System OR Weather Summary App**  
    Manage stock items (add/remove/view) *or* display simple weather summaries (static data).

Each project builds on the previous one, gradually increasing difficulty and reinforcing real programming logic.  
This repository reflects my consistent progress and growing confidence with Python fundamentals.
